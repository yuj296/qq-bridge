# QQ ↔ DeepSeek Harness Bridge (qq-bridge)

**Original author: [Derpyu520](https://github.com/Derpyu520)** — upstream repository: [**Derpyu520/qq-bridge**](https://github.com/Derpyu520/qq-bridge)
**This repository** is a fork maintained by [yuj296](https://github.com/yuj296) (**the DSH 0.1.2 port**), adding protocol support and features on top of the original work. All credit for the original project belongs to its author.

> Connect QQ messages to DeepSeek Harness (DSH) agents: QQ friends/groups become DSH conversations, and agent replies (including questions and tool approvals) are sent back to QQ.

## What this fork adds

| Addition | Details | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DSH 0.1.2 protocol port** | Upstream depends on `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-apiproxy`, removed in DSH 0.1.2-alpha.1 — the original cannot connect at all. This fork rewrites the client: cookie auth via `?token=`, auto-discovery of port/token, `$events` waterfall replies, `session/follow` multiplexed event stream | `src/dsh-client.js`, `PORTING-DSH-0.1.2.md` |
| **"QQ Bot" settings section** | A new section in the DSH settings sidebar (right below *General*), exposing **156 options** in 10 groups with per-field descriptions; saving takes effect within 5s. Precedence: **fields edited in the UI > `config.json` (disk) = console edits > code defaults**; untouched fields are never rewritten | `plugins/qq-mode-console/` |
| **Sidebar "Wake" button** | One row under *Skill Center*: starts SnowLuma + the bridge and sends the owner a QQ message. Local, same-origin requests only (strict IP-literal trust fence; console token never reaches the page) | `plugins/qq-wake/` |
| **Approvals & task-done notifications on your phone** | Tool approvals are relayed to the owner's QQ ("approve"/"deny" to decide); turns longer than 5 minutes (configurable) send a completion notice | `src/bridge.js` |
| **Optional auto-start supervisor (not installed by default)** | Scheduled task + 5-minute watchdog; by default nothing auto-starts — the bot only comes up when you press **Wake** | `tools/README.md` |
| **Docs & self-tests** | `AGENTS.md` (file map / invariants / pitfalls / constraints), porting notes, plugin/wake/settings test scripts | `AGENTS.md`, `scripts/test-*.mjs` |

## Architecture

```
QQ messages ──► SnowLuma (OneBot v11 WS) ──► qq-bridge ──► DSH Web API (127.0.0.1:3080/api)
                                                    ▲                      │
                                                    └── agent replies / questions / approvals ┘
```

- **QQ side**: `@snowluma/sdk` provides the OneBot v11 WebSocket client.
- **DSH side**: reuses `@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-apiproxy` and implements the Node transport layer.
- **Agent tools**: safe MCP servers expose a restricted QQ toolset (`qq_status`, `qq_list_groups`, `qq_get_group_history`, `qq_send_group_message`, `qq_reply`, etc.).
- **Console**: a local web console at `http://127.0.0.1:3100` for mode switching, role management, whitelist/admin settings, slang management, memory, stickers and more.

## Features

- Bridges QQ group/private messages to DSH agent sessions.
- Social simulation mode ("simulated group friend") with idle/active/probing/exiting states.
- Space-based message splitting for more natural multi-message replies.
- Whitelist/blacklist access control, fail-closed by default.
- Sensitive text audit prevents paths/credentials from being sent to QQ.
- MCP tools for reading group history/members, sending messages, replying with quotes, and (in `reserved2`) full simulated-group-friend tooling.
- Slang/network-expression learning with human confirmation.
- Lightweight memory system for active topics, pending thoughts and member impressions.
- Sticker library integration with AI-friendly sticker usage.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.13
- Running DeepSeek Harness Web (default `http://127.0.0.1:3080`)
- Running SnowLuma with OneBot v11 WebSocket and HTTP API enabled

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install        # postinstall automatically patches the @snowluma/sdk ESM packaging bug
```

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json`, then edit:

```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Key settings:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `dsh.baseUrl` | DSH Web API URL, default `http://127.0.0.1:3080` |
| `snowluma.wsUrl` | SnowLuma OneBot **WebSocket** URL (e.g. `ws://127.0.0.1:3001`) |
| `snowluma.accessToken` | OneBot access token, leave empty if not configured |
| `snowluma.httpUrl` | OneBot **HTTP API** URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3000`); do not point this at the WebSocket port or you will get HTTP 426 |
| `ownerQQ` | Administrator QQ (highest privilege) |
| `allow.private` / `allow.groups` | Whitelist of QQ/group IDs |
| `consolePort` | Local console port, default `3100` |

Start:

```bash
npm start
```

Or double-click `start.bat` on Windows (guard mode with auto-restart).

## DSH Setup on Another Device

The bridge and console can run without extra DSH setup, but the two DSH chat presets (`qq-chat` and `qq-chat-v2`) and the MCP servers must be installed into DSH once per machine:

```bash
node scripts/setup-dsh.mjs
```

This installs:

- `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/qq-chat` and `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/qq-chat-v2`
- MCP entries in `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`
- `qq-mode-console` in the profile `package.json`
- Default DSH mode set to `reserved2` (second-generation simulation), with a local `state/mode.json` fallback

Then restart DSH. See [docs/DSH_SETUP.md](docs/DSH_SETUP.md) for details.

## Security Notes

- `config.json` and `state/` are **never committed**; the repository only ships `config.example.json`.
- MCP send tools enforce whitelist checks and reject CQ-code injection.
- Local paths, credentials, tokens and other sensitive patterns are filtered by the audit layer.
- Process control for SnowLuma (`start_snowluma` / `stop_snowluma`) is disabled by default and only allowed in `closed-agent` mode when explicitly enabled.
- The console uses a generated token when none is configured.
